        <h1>Pollution Around the World</h1>
        <p>Everyone knows littering is a 'bad thing' and that we should be aware to recycle paper when we can. However, the big question is, what happens if you do choose to take a 5 minute drive instead of a 10 minute walk? Or what happens if you do choose the plastic straw over the paper one?
            The answer is, if we all collectively choose the previous option, the impact is a lot bigger than you think.
            Pollution is a worldwide issue, causing 'irrepairable' damage to our environment as well as impacting humans, affecting over 100 million people across the world. As shown, pollution comes in many different forms such as air and water pollution, which are the two most damaging forms of pollution. The following report explores the impact of pollution as well as each countries' contribution pollution across the world.

              <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
              <p>Air pollution is deadly, causing almost 7 million deaths per year, which is comparable to serious health diseases such as obesity, causing over 6 million deaths per year. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Air pollution also deteriorates the state of our natural environment, such as via its contributions to global warming. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is one of the biggest contributors to global warming with its heat trapping nature, causing the increased rate of melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels and increasing average temperature. 
            </p>
                Over the years, CO2 appears to be increasing over the years across majority of countries. It appears that Australia, Canada and the United states have their CO2 levels particularly high throughout the years. This correlates to their extensive use fossil fuel consumption as an energy source.
                <p>
                As shown, low to middle countries with lower GDP per capita such as India, Afghanistan and China appear to result in higher death rates resulting from air pollution. For an example, Afghanistan had remained as the top country to have the highest death rate per 100,000 people across years 2000 to 2015, with a high rate of 531 deaths per 100,000 in 2000.  Countries with larger populations of around 7 million and above, also appear to a have a faster rate of decrease in death rate in comparison to other countries, such a Russia, dropping their rate by 30 deaths per 100,000 from 2000 to 2015. However, over the years and across all countries, death rates resulting from air pollution appear to be decreasing, which could be due to the gradual shift to using renewable energy sources.

              <h2>Plastic Pollution</h2>
              <p>Plastic is used in many different forms throughout all countries, whether if it is in the form of a single use plastic cups or in the form or parts for a car. However due to its non-biodegradable nature, it can take hundreds of years to breakdown hence significantly contributes to the harm of pollution.  As shown below, the top 3 countries in producing the most plastic waste appear to be the top 3 most populated countries being United States, China and India. Up until 2018, the three countries combined had produced almost 100 million metric tonnes of plastic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plastic can end up anywhere, such as in oceans, which can harm the marine wildlife and environment. Animals such as sea birds that live by the coastal areas and seals that live offshore are greatly impacted, particularly from microplastics. As shown below, plastics that have been polluted in coastal and offshore areas of the ocean back from 1970s still significantly impact todays wildlife, due to its long degrading nature, where over 120,000 tonnes of plastic that date back in 1990 are still in today's waters.

          <h2>Ocean Pollution</h2>
          <p>As mentioned, pollution overall can greatly harm marine wildlife and marine environment. However, one of the major types of pollution that greatly impact the ocean are oil spills. Majority of the number of oil spills across the years is made up of small oil spill incidents, with the number of large oil spills being relatively consistent throughout the years. With stricter regulations put in place in the recent years, the number of oil spill incidents are significantly decreasing.</p>
